# We use two separate Docker containers: one for the database and one for the
# Wekan application. The Wekan container doensnâ€™t contain any mutable state
# (all the user data, even uploads, are saved in the database) so updating it
# is as simple as stoping the old version and starting the new one. If you want
# to update the database you need to uncomment the volume section below.

wekandb:
  image: mongo
#  volumes:
#    - ./data/runtime/db:/data/db
#    - ./data/dump:/dump
  command: mongod --smallfiles --oplogSize 128
